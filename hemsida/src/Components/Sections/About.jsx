         Hi my name is Elvis and I am 22 years old. I like to train, hike, hang out with friends and travel.
         Through my previous experiences such as in the restaurant industry, warehouse management, service and sales, I have learned to work at a high pace, set high goals and to deliver first-class service to customers.
         This has given me a solid knowledge in creating relationships, delivering quality and service to my customers.
         I have worked everything from helping customers find the right menu to clothing and their everyday problems with insurance and banking.
            <br/><br />
            My view of sales is about listening to the customer's needs and finding a solution that suits them, being an expert in my field and providing a personal experience for the customer, that's something I'm passionate about. 
            It gives so much back and shows that I value the customer.
            Sales is not about driving over the customer but adding value to the customer. Selling them something they benefit from and leaving the conversation with a smile.
            <br/><br />
            I'm very driven as a person and love to give my customers the best service.
            Through my drive, I show that my work is about being positive and happy. It spreads a good vibe in the workplace among colleagues but above all customers.
            For me to thrive and be motivated in a workplace, challenge, responsibility and personal development are required. I am very curious, initiative taking and love to learn new things.

            Contact me to get your new star at your workplace.
